### (Optional) Install Dependencies for Styling
The project uses Font Awesome for icons and Select2 for enhanced dropdown functionality. These libraries are loaded via CDN and should work out of the box.

## How to Use

2. Enter the transaction amount.
3. Select whether it is an income or expense from the dropdown menu.
4. Click the **Add Entry** button to save the transaction.

### Editing a Transaction
1. In the transaction list, click the **Edit** icon next to the transaction you want to modify.
2. Modify the details in the input fields.

### Filtering Transactions
Choose between "All," "Income," or "Expense" filters to view transactions selectively.

### Reset Form
To clear the form fields without saving, click the **Reset** button.

## Data Persistence
All transactions are stored in localStorage, so the data persists even when you refresh or close the browser. To clear all transactions, you will need to manually clear your browser's localStorage or delete each transaction individually.
